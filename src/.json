If there is a “YES” response to Question 2 or 3, you must complete SBA Form 912 and furnish details on a separate sheet, including dates, location, fines, sentences, whether misdemeanor or felony, dates of parole/probation, unpaid fines or penalties, name(s) under which charged, and any other pertinent information. If “YES” to Questions 2 or 3, the lender will be required to conduct a background check and make a character determination in accordance with the procedures described in SOP 50 10 5. If “YES” to Question 3 and you are currently on parole or probation (including probation before judgment), the loan request is ineligible for SBA assistance. If the charge resulting in a “YES” was a single misdemeanor that was subsequently dropped without prosecution, you must provide documentation from the appropriate court or prosecutor’s office along with the completed Form 912.
